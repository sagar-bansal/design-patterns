Design patterns are solutions to specific problems.Eg only one object: singleton
These are documented and understandable by diff SDE and Architect
Tried and tested solution to common problems hence reduced technical risk
They are language neutral
Solution is easy and extendable

 Creational

Focus on way of creating objects
Define and describe how objects are created 

Factory : Basically its for hiding the details and returning the object of the specified class which is inherited from the parent interface
          We need to have a factory and the client(main) creates an object of factory. In factory we have a method which creates different objects based on the parameter.
          Now the client calls that method with the parameter nd accepts the object in a variable of type of the parent interface.
